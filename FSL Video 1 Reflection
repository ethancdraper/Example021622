When this video started out by showing watchers where to find the terminal, I knew I was in the right spot. This video explained interchangeable terminology (e.g., folders vs directories), how commands are named (e.g., ls = LiSt), and provides a handout with common Unix commands (a helpful tool), giving a strong foundation which I felt was much clearer than the previous tutorial. This seems to be designed for individuals who are in the exact same position that I am, and switched frequently between the terminal and graphical folders to elucidate the connection between what is happening in the terminal and what inexperienced individuals might be more familiar with (the graphical interface). The video also referenced available data, and the FSL course seems to be set up similarly to PSYC 394 lab where individuals have the opportunity to run through commands with provided data. I greatly anticipate that following this tutorial will not only consolidate the bits of information I’ve gathered from the other tutorial, but will provide me with a much clearer picture that I currently possess of the ‘real world’ applications. This tutorial also has an assumption about zero prior skills in this area, which I did not feel the previous tutorial did. I would suggest this tutorial (as opposed to the previous one) for future students in my position who become involved in your lab.
