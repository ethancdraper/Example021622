I’m used to academic skills coming quite naturally to me, so this has definitely been a humbling learning experience as I failed to execute the first section of the tutorial numerous times. For that same reason, however, this success was much more gratifying. Will the next section of the tutorial take me as long? Perhaps, but (even though it may not be the most fun to experience) academic resilience is an important skill and is something that I believe will serve me well as I progress in my career. I’m really glad that I wasn’t discouraged from learning this. It's also more fun than I was expecting!
